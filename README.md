mkspec
======

A small tool for making matching spec & production code files.


Usage
-----

`mkspec app/lib/foo.rb`

Now you have an empty file at `app/lib/foo.rb`,
and an RSpec file at `spec/app/lib/foo.rb`.


Installation
------------

1. Get mkspec on your path somehow.
2. Make sure the `support` folder is a sibling of mkspec
3. Make some specs
